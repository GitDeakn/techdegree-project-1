Random Quote Generator

This application generates a random quote, displays it on the page every time the button is pressed.

I started with storing a list of quotes in an array.

Every quote in the array is an object containing the following properties: quote and source. Some quotes contain the properties: citation and year.

I used the getRandomQuote funtion to return a random quote object from the quotes array.

Then used the printQuote function to return the properties that the object may include and display them on the page.
